I have included two papers that I wrote where I conducted experiments that investigated ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. I analyzed the data, as well as ran statistical tests on them.
I have processed through large data sets in my research positions too, specifically by creating graphs and running statistical analyses on it. 

Here is the link to the first paper: I wrote it for DUJUS in Fall of 2020 and it is on page 138: https://issuu.com/dartmouthjournalofscience/docs/20f_dujs_print_journal_v3
I have also included the pdf version in this repository. The second paper is also in this repository.
